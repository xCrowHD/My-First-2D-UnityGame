# My-First-2D-UnityGame

## This is a very old project of mine, I tried to improve some aspects but some parts are pretty messy, still I wanted to share what my first 2D game looks like. 

### As for now this project will not be updated.

### I wanted to make it .exe but i had some weird problem with the enemy not moving and other minor problem. Probably because i update my unity version. So for now you need to compile the game first in unity and play from there.

### Command for the game :

- Left and Right arrow to move
- Z to Melee Attack
- X to use default Blink Ability
- C to Shoot
- Space to Jump
- J to checking the stats
- B for Buy From Merchant
